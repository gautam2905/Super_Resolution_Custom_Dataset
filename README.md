# Super_Resolution_Custom_Dataset

## 1. Introduction
Though many attempts have been made in blind super-resolution to restore low-resolution images with unknown and complex degradations, they are still far from addressing general real-world degraded images. In this work, I have implemented one such algorithm that is SRGAN. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802).

## 2. Installations and Dependencies

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements provided in the requirements.txt file
3. Download training dataset
   - The data I used was High-Resolution Images: [Train Data](http://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/DIV2K_train_HR.zip)
4. Extract and paste the data inside the DIV2k folder
5. Run the test.py python  file
